The Proof of Concept (POC) for the Facebook Helpdesk application involves creating a web-based platform where clients can register and connect their Facebook accounts. The app will allow users to manage their Facebook page connections, listen to messenger messages, and reply to them within the application. Conversations will be organized, and team members can collaborate on replying to messages, thereby streamlining communication management. The UI/UX will be designed to ensure a user-friendly experience, with attention to clean code structure and efficient execution. Technical aspects will involve utilizing Facebook's developer resources and integrating with a database for data management. The POC will demonstrate the core functionalities of user registration, Facebook page connection management, message processing, and conversation handling.
